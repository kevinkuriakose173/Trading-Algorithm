Overview
  This project analyzes historical price data of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and implements a machine learning model to predict daily price movements. The goal is to compare a strategy based on these predictions against a simple buy-and-hold strategy, using various technical indicators and metrics.

Features
  Data Analysis: Visualizes SPY's closing price (1990-2023).
  Feature Engineering: Calculates:
    Percentage change in closing prices.
    Moving averages (10, 50, and 200 days) and their relative differences.
    Crossover signals (e.g., 10-day MA crossing 50-day MA).
    MACD and RSI signals for trend analysis.
  Machine Learning Model: Implements a RandomForestClassifier to predict if the next day's price will increase.
  Backtesting:
    Evaluates strategy performance based on model predictions.
    Compares predicted strategy balance to a buy-and-hold approach.
  Performance Metrics:
    Classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score).
    Financial metrics (portfolio balances for algorithmic vs. buy-and-hold strategies).
Prerequisites
  Python 3.7+
  Required Libraries:
    pandas
    numpy
    matplotlib
    yfinance
    sklearn
Install dependencies via:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib yfinance scikit-learn
How It Works
  Data Retrieval:
    Historical SPY price data is fetched using yfinance.
  Feature Engineering:
    Calculates technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, MACD, RSI) and prepares target labels for classification.
  Model Training and Prediction:
    A RandomForestClassifier predicts daily price movements.
  Backtesting:
    Evaluates the strategy using historical data in rolling windows.
  Visualization:
    Plots closing prices, strategy balances, and buy-and-hold balances for comparison.
  Metrics Calculation:
    Reports classification and financial metrics to assess strategy performance.
Results
  Graphs:
    Closing prices (1990-2023).
    Portfolio balance comparison for predicted strategy vs. buy-and-hold.
  Metrics:
    Days of growth/decline in SPY.
    True positives/negatives, false positives/negatives for predictions and actions.
    Portfolio balances at the end of the period.
Usage
  Run the script to:
    Fetch and analyze SPY data.
    Train and test a prediction model.
    Backtest the strategy and visualize results.
    Review financial and classification metrics.
Future Improvements
  Optimize the machine learning model (e.g., hyperparameter tuning).
  Include additional technical indicators.
  Expand to other assets or indices.
  Add risk-adjusted performance metrics.
